# Symbolic-Regression

In this project, we will use genetic programming to perform symbolic regression. Each organism's genetic code will be represented by a computational tree that consists of the defined operations. 

The full project report on results and reasoning can be found in [`Symbolic_Regression.pdf`](https://github.com/upadhyan/Symbolic-Regression/blob/main/Symbolic_Regression.pdf). 

The project code can be seen in [`GP_Execution.ipynb`](https://github.com/upadhyan/Symbolic-Regression/blob/main/GP_Execution.ipynb).
